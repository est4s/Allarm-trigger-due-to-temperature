This was built for an electric car which was a team's project from my school for Efficiency Challenge competition of Tubitak. This s a trigger circuit that triggers a siren light due to the temperatures that are set by Tubitak.

Components:
- Arduino uno
- 1 channel 5 volts relay module
- 2 2x16 lcd screens
- 2 lm35 sensors
- 2 potentiomenters
- Resistors for lcd screens
